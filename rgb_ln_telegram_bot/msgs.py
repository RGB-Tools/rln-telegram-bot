This bot helps testing RGB on LN\.
This can be done using Iris Wallet desktop which you can find in its \
[GitHub releases page]\
(https://github.com/RGB-Tools/iris-wallet-desktop/releases)\.

Under the hood \
[RLN \(rgb\-lightning\-node\)](https://github.com/RGB-Tools/rgb-lightning-node) \
is used to provide LN functionality on a shared regtest\.

Features:
1\. get on\-chain bitcoins
2\. get on\-chain RGB assets
3\. pay an RGB LN invoice to simulate the purchase of a virtual item

How to test an RGB LN payment:
1\. request on\-chain bitcoins with the /{sett.GETBTC_CMD} command
2\. request on\-chain assets with the /{sett.GETASSET_CMD} command
3\. open an RGB LN channel with the received asset towards the bot's LN \
node\. Use /{sett.GETNODEINFO_CMD} to get the necessary info
4\. request an RGB LN invoice with the /{sett.GETINVOICE_CMD} command
5\. pay the invoice and wait for feedback from the bot
