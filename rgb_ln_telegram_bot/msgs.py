This bot helps testing RGB on LN\.
This can be done using \
[RLN \(rgb\-lightning\-node\)](https://github.com/RGB-Tools/rgb-lightning-node) \
on testnet\.

Features:
1\. get RGB assets on\-chain
2\. pay an RGB LN invoice to simulate the purchase of a virtual item

How to test an RGB LN payment:
1\. request on\-chain assets with the /{sett.GETASSET_CMD} command
2\. open an RGB LN channel with the received asset towards the bot's LN \
node\. Use /{sett.GETNODEINFO_CMD} to get the necessary info
3\. request an RGB LN invoice with the /{sett.GETINVOICE_CMD} command
4\. pay the invoice and wait for feedback from the bot

If you need help operating RLN you can use the /{sett.NODECOMMANDHELP_CMD} \
command\.

When using swagger, you can use the same request body from `curl` \
